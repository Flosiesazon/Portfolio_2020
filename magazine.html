  <p>raphic design is one of the module that I like because I was able to showcase my artistic and creativity side in various ways such as drawing digitally, and use my basic knowledge in layouts, typography and using colours. There are many things that I want to explore and learn more in graphc designs as it is interesting for me. I also learned that graphic design does not have to be all about designing magazines, leaflet, brochures etc. using photographs and typography as we can still draw digitally and apply our own style to it which I love because I am able to share my thoughts and styles to other people.</p>

    <h1 class="drop-cap">I</h1>
    <p>designed a pop art themed magazine during the first semester of my second year. At first I was a  bit skeptical with the theme I received as I had to design mostly using the primary colours. Thanks to the research stage that I have conducted, I was able to learn how to use the bright colours properly and I was also able to understand what design would be suitable for my project and what typography I must use. I decided to  use shapes such as circles and squares as they are versatile and lines were also used in designing the project.<br>
      <br>
      The most important thing that I also want to showcase is my own style by adding textures to my work. I think that texture does really give a more natural and realistic effect to it which I really love. </p>

    <p>his is one of my recent book covers that I have designed outside college work. This is a cover for a poetry portfolio that one of my friends wrote for college purposes as well. Although I know her personally, I still tried my best to treat her as one of my clients as she still has some specific requirements that I must meet. The milk bottle was drawn by me using Sketchbook, a drawing app and I added the fonts using Adobe Illustrator to have more options. <br>
      <br>
      Overall, I was happy with the results and the client as well. This tasks also helped me to improve my drawing skills  digitally and my designing skills.</p>

  <p>he book cover designs above are mock-ups that I have created for our Game Design and Development 2021 writing project this semester. At first I was not sure if my peers would like my design but I volunteered as I wanted to have more experience and improve my skills. Although it is an outside task, I am still glad that I took a risk as I was able to improve my designing skills and gained more confidence in my own work. <br>
    <br>
    These two mock-up designs have different styles and ambiance to it. For the first cover, I tried to have a design that provides a more educational looking cover therefore I used an image of a chess board and sets of pieces to make it seem  professional. However, the second design is more modern and has a gaming feel to it that my fellow students prefer. I based the colour theme here by taking the colour from the image and gradually working up my design from there. </p>

    <h1 class="drop-cap">F</h1>
    <p>or my last book cover design, I decided to show you my first book cover project. I experienced a lot of challenges throughout the design process of this book cover as I had to create an image made out of letters therefore I must use a meaningful product that connects to the book itself. Trying to fit the texts inside a section was very time consuming however, all of the hard work paid off after I completed the whole design. Everything that was applied to this cover was really connected to the overall content of the book and I am proud of this work. It also thought that making mistakes along the way is also a process and I bacome more patient with my work.</p>

<div class="bookcover-content4">
  <h1>LEAFLET</h1>
  <img src="images/Leaflet-design.jpg" alt="Leaflet design"/> </div>
<div class="bookcover-content5">
  <h1 class="drop-cap">T</h1>
  <p>his is a leaflet that I designed from our Design Process and Practice module during the second semester in first year. This project really helped me to build my foundation in patience and the designing process as we conducted a long research such as the discoverery, define, develop and deliver phase. Even though the designing stage itself was difficult and challenging, I had to follow the stages respectively and wait for the right time to design the leaflet. <br>
    <br>
    Therefore, you must take the researching, surveys, style/concept library, and design inspirations into consideration if you want to have a perfect product that you are proud of at the end. Do not hesitate to take risks and accept your mistakes as they are a part of the process to help you discover a better way to convey your art. This project also teached me how to set my boundaries on how much I must go while designing especially in this work because I have a specific client and target audience to impress. </p>
